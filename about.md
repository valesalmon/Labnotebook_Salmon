---layout: default---I am a graduate student at Hawaii Pacific University interested in the identification of genetic signatures of climate change in marine intertidal invertebrates. My thesis project focuses on understanding the response of 'opihi, an endemic Hawaiian limpet, to thermal and desiccation stress. By measuring heart rate, body temperature, and analyzing differential gene expression between stressed and non-stressed animals, I aim to understand the adaptive capacity of these intertidal organisms.### Contact: [ssamus1@my.hpu.edu](mailto:ssamus1@my.hpu.edu)
